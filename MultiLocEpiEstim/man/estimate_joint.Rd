pathogen/strain/variant and the relative transmissibility of a
"new" pathogen/strain/variant}
\usage{
estimate_joint(
  incid,
  si_distr,
  priors,
  mcmc_control = default_mcmc_controls(),
  t_min = 2,
  t_max = nrow(incid),
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{incid}{a multidimensional array containing values of the incidence
for each time step (1st dimension), location (2nd dimension) and
pathogen/strain/variant (3rd dimension)}

\item{si_distr}{a matrix with two columns, each containing the probability mass
function for the discrete serial interval for each of the two
pathogen/strain/variants, starting with the probability mass function
for day 0 in the first row, which should be 0. each column in the matrix
should sum to 1}

\item{priors}{a list of prior parameters (shape and scale of a gamma
distribution) for epsilon and R; can be obtained from the function
\code{default_priors}. The prior for R is assumed to be the same for all
time steps and all locations}

\item{t_min}{an integer >1 giving the minimum time step to consider in the
estimation. Default value is 2 (as the estimation is conditional on
observations at time step 1 and can therefore only start at time step 2).}

\item{t_max}{an integer >\code{t_min} and <=\code{nrow(incid)} giving the maximum time
step to consider in the estimation. Default value is \code{nrow(incid)}.}

\item{seed}{a numeric value used to fix the random seed}

\item{mcmc_controls}{a list of default MCMC control parameters, as obtained
for example from function \code{default_mcmc_controls}}
}
\value{
a list with two elements.
\enumerate{
\item \code{epsilon} is a matrix containing the MCMC chain (thinned and after
burnin) for the relative transmissibility of the "new"
pathogen/strain/variant(s) compared to the reference
pathogen/strain/variant. Each row in the matrix is a "new"
pathogen/strain/variant and each column an iteration of the MCMC.
\item \code{R_out} is an array containing the MCMC chain (thinned and after
burnin) for the reproduction number for the reference
pathogen/strain/variant. The first dimension of the array is time,
the second location, and the third iteration of the MCMC.
